README

This code sets up a simple server using the Express and Socket.io libraries. The server listens on port 3333 and emits events for incoming text and image messages.

Getting started

Install the necessary dependencies by running npm install express http socket.io
Start the server by running node app.js
The server will begin listening on port 3333 and will log a message to the console when a user connects or disconnects.
The server will also log incoming text and image messages and will emit them to all connected clients.

Events

The server listens for the following events:

send-text: emitted when a client sends a text message
send-image: emitted when a client sends an image
The server emits the following events:

receive-text: emitted when a text message is received by the server
receive-image: emitted when an image is received by the server

Customization

You can customize the server by adding additional event listeners or modifying the behavior of existing ones.
